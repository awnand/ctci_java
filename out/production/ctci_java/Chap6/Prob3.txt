QUESTION

There is an 8x8 chessboard in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off.  You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly two squares.  Can you use the 31 dominoes to cover the entire board?  Prove your answer (by providing an example or showing why it is impossible).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SOLUTION

The chessboard initially has 32 black and 32 white squares.  By removing opposite corners, we're left with 30 of one color and 32 of another color.  Let's say we have 30 black and 32 white squares.  Each domino we set on the board will always take up one white and one black square.  Therefore, 31 dominos will take up 31 white squares and 31 black squares exactly.  On this board, however, we must have 30 black squares and 32 white squares.  Hence it is impossible.
