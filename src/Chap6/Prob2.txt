QUESTION

You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play one of two ames.
Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop.
Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make two of three shots.
If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p should you pick one game or the other?

SOLUTION

We can use straightforward probability laws to solve this one. For game 1, the probability of winning is simple: p.  For game 2, the probability of winning is the probability you make 2 or 3 shots, which can be found by finding the probability of making 2 shots and adding it with the probability of making 3 shots.

Using the binomial distribution we have:
P(making 2 shots) = (3 choose 2)*(p^2)*(1-p)
P(making 2 shots) = 3p^2*(1-p)
P(making 2 shots) - 3p^2 - 3p^3

For those that are not familiar with the binomial distribution, we can also find the probability this way:
P(making 2 shots) = P(making the first 2 shots, missing the last one) + P(making the last 2 shots, missing the first one) + P(making the first and the third shot, missing the second one)
P(making 2 shots) = p*p*(1-p) + (1-p)*p*p + p*(1-p)*p
P(making 2 shots) = p^2(1-p)*3
P(making 2 shots) = 3p^2 - 3p^3

Now we can find the probability of winning game 2:
P(winning game 2) = P(making 2 shots) + P(making 3 shots)
P(winning game 2) = 3p^2 - 3p^3 + p^3
P(winning game 2) = 3p^2 - 2p^3

To answer the question, we just need to solve the following:
P(winning game 1) > P(winning game 2)
p > 3p^2 - 2p^3
2p^2 - 3p + 1 > 0
(2p - 1)(p - 1) > 0
p < 0.5

Therefore, we should choose game 1 when p < 0.5, and choose game 2 when p >= 0.5
