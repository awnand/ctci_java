QUESTION

There are three ants on different vertices of a triangle.  What is the probability of collision (between any two or all of them) if they start walking on the sides of the triangle?  Assume that each ant randomly picks a direction, with either direction being equally likely to be chosen, and that they walk at the same speed.  Similarly, find the probability of collision with n ants on an n-vertex polygon.

SOLUTION

First we can find the probability of none of the ants colliding on the triangle:
P(No collision on triangle) = P(All ants go clockwise) + P(All ants go counter-clockwise)
P(No collision on triangle) = (1/2)^3 + (1/2)^3
P(No collision on triangle) = 1/4

Therefore, we can now subtract by 1 to find the probability of at least one collision:
P(Collision on triangle) = 1 - P(No collision on triangle)
P(Collision on triangle) = 1 - 1/4
P(Collision on triangle) = 3/4

No we can use a similar strategy to find the probabilities for the n ants on an n-vertex polygon:
P(No collision on polygon) = P(All ants go clockwise) + P(All ants go counter-clockwise)
P(No collision on polygon) = (1/2)^n + (1/2)^n
P(No collision on polygon) = 2*(1/2)^n
P(No collision on polygon) = (1/2)^(n-1)

P(Collision on polygon) = 1 - (1/2)^(n-1)
