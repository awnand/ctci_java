QUESTION

There are 100 closed lockers in a hallway.  A man begins by opening all 100 lockers.  Next, he closes every second locker.  Then, on his third pass, he toggles every third locker (closes it if it is open or opens if it is closed).  This process continues for 100 passes, such that on each pass i, the man toggles every ith locker.  After his 100th pass in the hallway, in which he toggles only locker #100, how many lockers are open?

SOLUTION

A door n is toggled once for each factor of n, including itself and 1.  That is, door 15 is toggled on rounds 1, 3, 5, and 15.
A door is left open if the number of factors (which we will call x) is odd.  You can think about this by pairing factors off as open and a close.  If there is one remaining, the door will be open.
Notice that x is only odd when n is a perfect square.  For example, if we have 64, the factors are (1, 64), (2, 32), (4, 16), (8, 8).  Notice that 8 only counts as a factor once, while the rest have a pair and therefore come in 2's.  Therefore only perfect squares will have x values that are odd.  How many perfect squares are there from 1 to 100?  There are exactly 10.
